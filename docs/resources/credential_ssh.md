# jenkins_credential_ssh Resource

Manages a SSH credential within Jenkins. This SSH credential may then be referenced within jobs that are created.

~> The "passphrase" and "privatekey" properties may leave plain-text values in your state file. Ensure that your state file is properly secured and encrypted at rest.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "jenkins_credential_ssh" "example" {
  name       = "example-id"
  username   = "example-username"
  privatekey = file("/some/path/id_rsa")
  passphrase = "Super_Secret_Pass"
}
```
