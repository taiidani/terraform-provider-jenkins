# Jenkins Provider

The Jenkins provider is used to interact with the Jenkins API. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the Jenkins Provider
provider "jenkins" {
  server_url = "http://localhost:8080" # Or JENKINS_URL env var
  username   = "admin"                 # Or JENKINS_USERNAME env var
  password   = "admin"                 # Or JENKINS_PASSWORD env var
  ca_cert    = ""                      # Or JENKINS_CA_CERT env var
}
```

## Authentication

Jenkins uses a user/password challenge for authentication. It requires a username & password for determining identity and permissions. This method also supports Jenkins' various authentication plugins, such as GitHub OAuth (through the use of Personal Access Tokens).
